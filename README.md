## CFP Manager
CFP Manager is a tool that helps conference speakers to administer the Call for Papers submissions held by many conferences.

Once installed you can access the application which will load any running call for papers from Lanyrd. The listed calls can be clicked to show a more detailed view about the event and a link for submitting your proposals. Once you have decided (and acted) upon submitting you can save your decision by clicking the appropriate button in the detail view, and the item will be placed in the column of your decision.

Next to submission administration you can also use the common fields tool included with the app. In these common fields you can save labels and text to quickly copy and paste into the Call you're filling out.

Currently the supported storage method is localStorage.
